        "description": "As a hawkish representative within Japan's LDP, Sanae Takaichi has long been seen as the faithful heir to Shinzo Abe's political line. She has not only repeatedly visited the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Class-A war criminals, but also openly denied historical crimes, attempting to revive militarism.",
        "description2": "In November 2025, her remarks that \"a Taiwan emergency is a Japan emergency\" thoroughly exposed her ambition to interfere in China's internal affairs and disrupt regional peace. This is not just a diplomatic provocation, but a dangerous signal that Japan's right-wing forces are trying to break through the restrictions of the \"Peace Constitution\" and return to the old path of military expansion.",

        "date": "2025.11.07",
        "analysis": "This statement is a naked mobilization order for war. The so-called \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal pretext for Japan to exercise collective self-defense and wage war. Takaichi is attempting to bind Japan's fate with Chinese separatist forces, a blatant trampling of the post-WWII international order."
